The project's name is H2E, which is why this repository is called H2E Visual. This repository includes H2Nose UI stack, JSON saves, recording & conversion tools, etc. For the C++ library for H2Nose, refer to this [H2NoseLib3](https://github.com/ivanaprianto/H2NoseLib3) library, which is used for the arduino in H2Nose.
